# Description

Simple command line interface to handle basic change management related actions
in SAP Solution Manager or with CTS via ODATA requests. The client is intended to be used
in continuous integration and continuous delivery scenarios and supports only
the actions necessary within those scenarios. See section _Usage_ for more details.

# Requirements
### SAP Solution Manager Functionality
 - SAP Solution Manager 7.2 SP6, SP7 -> cm_client v1.x
 - SAP Solution Manager 7.2 SP 8 and higher -> cm_client v2.0

### CTS+ without SAP Solution Manager

| AS ABAP Version       |     Service Pack    |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 7.50             |  > SP08             |
| 7.51             |  > SP07             |
| 7.52             |  > SP03             |

 - SAPUI 7.53

### General Requirements
 - JDK 8 to build this project (to run the client JRE 8 is sufficient) OR
 - a Docker environment to run the Docker image

# Download and Installation

This command line client can be consumed either as a Java application from [maven.org](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/sap/devops/cmclient/dist.cli) or as a Docker image from [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/ppiper/cm-client).

## Installation from maven.org

  - Download the command line interface package from [maven.org](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/sap/devops/cmclient/dist.cli)
  - Extract the command line interface package into suitable folder

    Example:
    ```
       CM_VERSION=2.0.1
       mkdir cm_client
       curl "http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/sap/devops/cmclient/dist.cli/${CM_VERSION}/dist.cli-${CM_VERSION}.tar.gz"  \
       |tar -C cm_client -xvf -
       cm_client/bin/cmclient --version
       cm_client/bin/cmclient --help
    ```
